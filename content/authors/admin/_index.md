I am a scientific mind who is trying to understand the etiology of diseases. One of my main interests is shedding light on pathological mechanisms in terms of epigenetic regulation.

My background is focused on the use of programming languages to answer biological questions, also including statistics and basic experimental techniques. I declare myself as a curious mind and also get involved in various research areas such as synthetic biology and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
